> Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
>
> There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
>
> Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory, or can be placed in the `src/assets` directory, if you prefer.
>
> We recommend that local images are kept in `src/` when possible so that Astro can transform, optimize and bundle them. Files in the `/public` directory are always served or copied into the build folder as-is, with no processing.
>
> Your local images stored in `src/assets` can be used by all files in your project: .astro, .md, .mdx, .mdoc, and other UI frameworks. Images can be stored in any folder, including alongside your content.
>
> Store your images in the `public/` folder if you want to avoid any processing or to have a direct public link to them.
