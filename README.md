## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/projects/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project01/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project02/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ editor/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *BaseLayout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 404.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory, or can be placed in the `src/assets` directory, if you prefer.

> We recommend that local images are kept in `src/` when possible so that Astro can transform, optimize and bundle them. Files in the `/public` directory are always served or copied into the build folder as-is, with no processing.
>
> Your local images stored in `src/` can be used by all files in your project: .astro, .md, .mdx, .mdoc, and other UI frameworks. Images can be stored in any folder, including alongside your content.
>
> Store your images in the `public/` folder if you want to avoid any processing or to have a direct public link to them.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                           |
